The Earnings-to-Price (E/P) ratio, also known as the earnings yield, is a financial metric that investors use to evaluate the relative value of stocks. It is calculated by dividing a company's earnings per share (EPS) by its stock price. We expect that stocks with higher E/P ratios may be less risky as they offer a higher yield, potentially cushioning the impact of market volatility. 
The size of the company, defined as market capitalization, is often related to the return on the stocks as well. This can be indicated by the size factor, which refers to the empirically verified phenomenon that mid and small-cap stocks, generally outperform large-cap stocks.
In this case, we want to verify these assumptions and learn about how the E/P ratio and size of the company relate to the stock returns and if we could use these two indicators to build portfolios. 
We also want to further incorporate E/P ratios and company size in portfolio construction to have better diversification, and we want to test the validity of two portfolio-building strategies in which the first strategy is to build portfolios based on sorting by E/P ratio first, then, sort by company size within each bin of E/P ratio, and the second strategy is to build portfolios based on sorting by company size first, then sort by E/P ratio.
